### 🎯 Objective

Optimize logistics decisions by defining a structured fleet assignment between in-house Red Trucks and alternative delivery methods (ARTM), based on customer profiles, addresses, and delivery cost. Predictive models and segmentation strategies were used to guide allocation and improve operational efficiency.

### 📈 Analytics Approach

- **Supervised learning** to predict optimal delivery method (Red vs. White Trucks)  
- **Unsupervised learning** to segment customers by behavior and volume  
- Two customer groups analyzed:
  - All customers  
  - Fountain-only buyers (excluding bottles, cans, CO2)

### 💡 Key Insights

- Feature engineering (e.g., RFM and customer growth) drove model performance  
- Decision Tree and Multinomial Logistic Regression models reached ~90% accuracy  
- Segmentation revealed three distinct customer groups  
- Red Truck volume decreased where interaction wasn't essential (e.g., call center orders)

### 💰 Business Impact

- Estimated savings: **$770,000** over two years  
- Fleet reallocation affected only **14%** of customers  
- Delivered cost efficiency and identified potential growth segments  
- Opportunity for increased sales with strategic customers

### 🧠 Lessons Learned & Future Work

- Historical data (2 years) limited long-term forecasting  
- Customer seasonality posed tracking challenges  
- Census data needs better integration  
- Strong emphasis on interpretability and responsible decision-making  
- Recommend future testing of fleet strategy impacts and order channels  
- Revenue and margin analysis could further enrich insights
